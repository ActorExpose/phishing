## @polkadot/phishing

A curated list of known less-than-honest sites inclusive of a simple JS utility function to check any host against this list.

## Additions

To add a new site, edit [all.json](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing/edit/master/all.json) and add any new entries, single or multiples is allowed per edit.

To add a new scam address (typically per site), edit [address.json](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing/edit/master/address.json) and add it in the correct section (which is keyed by the site providing them).

## Availability

These can be consumed via the [@polkadot/phishing library](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing/tree/master/packages/phishing) and other tools.
