## @polkadot/phishing

A curated list of known less-than-honest sites inclusive of a simple JS utility function to check any host against this list.

Any additions can be made by editing [all.json](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing/edit/master/all.json) and adding any new sites in alphabetical order. 

Making additions to the list will be reflected (on merge) at [polkadot.js.org/phishing/all.json](https://polkadot.js.org/phishing/all.json) and can be consumed via the [@polkadot/phishing library](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing/tree/master/packages/phishing) and other tools.
